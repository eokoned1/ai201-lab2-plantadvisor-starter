# Spec: Tool Functions

**File:** `tools.py`
**Status:** `get_seasonal_conditions` — Pre-implemented, read through. `lookup_plant` — complete spec fields before implementing.

---

## Purpose

These two functions are the tools the agent can call. They retrieve structured data from the local plant database and seasonal data files and return it to the agent loop, which passes it to the LLM as context for generating a response.

---

## Function 1: `lookup_plant()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `plant_name` | `str` | The plant name as entered by the user or chosen by the LLM — may be any casing, common name, scientific name, or alias |

**Output:** `dict`

When the plant is **found**, return:
```python
{"found": True, "plant": <the full plant dict from _plant_db>}
```

When the plant is **not found**, return:
```python
{"found": False, "name": <normalized input>, "message": <helpful string>}
```

---

### Design Decisions

*Complete the two blank fields below before writing code. The others are pre-filled for you.*

---

#### Input normalization

Strip leading/trailing whitespace and convert to lowercase before any comparison.

```python
normalized = plant_name.strip().lower()
```

---

#### Search order

Search in this order: direct key → display name → aliases. Keys are the fastest
lookup (O(1) dict access), so check those first. Display names are the next most
likely match for clean user input. Aliases are the broadest net, so they go last.

```
1. Direct key match: normalized in _plant_db
2. Display name match: plant["display_name"].lower() == normalized
3. Alias match: normalized in [alias.lower() for alias in plant["aliases"]]
```

---

#### Alias matching approach

*Aliases are stored as a list of strings. How will you check if the normalized input matches any alias in the list? Write your approach in pseudocode or plain English.*

```
For each plant entry, lowercase+strip every alias and test membership of the
normalized input against that collection:

    normalized in (alias.strip().lower() for alias in plant["aliases"])

A generator expression keeps the comparison lazy (stops at the first hit) and
mirrors the same normalization applied to the input, so casing/whitespace can
never cause a false miss.

Scaling note: this is O(n·aliases) across the whole DB. If the database grew to
thousands of plants, I'd build a single lookup dict ONCE at module load that maps
every key, display name, and alias (all normalized) -> the plant entry. Lookup
then becomes a single O(1) dict access instead of a full scan per query.
```

---

#### Not-found message

*When a plant isn't found, the agent will read your message and use it to decide what to tell the user. Write the exact string you'll return — make it useful to the agent, not just to a human reading logs.*

```
"No plant matching '<plant_name>' was found in the care database. Do not invent
specific care numbers as if they came from the database. Acknowledge to the user
that this plant isn't in your database, then offer general guidance based on the
plant type or what the user described, and suggest they confirm specifics with a
trusted source."

Rationale: the message isn't a log line — it's an instruction the LLM reads as
tool output. It names the failure, forbids fabricating data (prevents the
"confidently wrong" failure mode), and prescribes the graceful-degradation
behavior we want. "Not found" alone would leave the agent with nothing to act on.
```

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after implementing and running the app.*

**Test: does `"devil's ivy"` return the pothos entry?**
```
Yes — matches via the aliases list ("devil's ivy" is a pothos alias). found: True.
```

**Test: does `"SNAKE PLANT"` return the snake plant entry?**
```
Yes — lowercasing the input matches the "Snake Plant" display name. found: True.
Also verified "  Pothos  " (whitespace) and "mother-in-law's tongue" (alias).
```

**One edge case you discovered while implementing:**
```
The aliases themselves need the same normalization as the input. Several aliases
in plants.json are stored with apostrophes and mixed phrasing (e.g.
"mother-in-law's tongue"), so I strip+lowercase each alias at comparison time
rather than assuming the JSON is already normalized — otherwise a stray case or
space in the data file would cause a false miss.
```

## Function 2: `get_seasonal_conditions()`

### Input / Output Contract

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `season` | `str \| None` | One of `"spring"`, `"summer"`, `"fall"`, `"winter"`, or `None` to auto-detect |

**Output:** `dict`

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus one additional field:

| Added field | Type | Value |
|-------------|------|-------|
| `"detected_season"` | `bool` | `True` if auto-detected from the month; `False` if season was passed as an argument |

---

### Design Decisions

*This function is pre-implemented — read through these fields and the code before working on `lookup_plant`.*

---

#### Auto-detection logic

When `season` is `None`, get the current calendar month with `datetime.now().month`
and look it up in the `_MONTH_TO_SEASON` dict, which maps month numbers to season strings.

```python
current_month = datetime.now().month
season_key = _MONTH_TO_SEASON[current_month]
```

---

#### Season validation

If the caller passes an invalid season string (e.g., `"monsoon"`), the function
falls back to auto-detection — same as if `None` were passed. The `VALID_SEASONS`
set acts as the gate:

```python
VALID_SEASONS = {"spring", "summer", "fall", "winter"}
if season and season.lower() in VALID_SEASONS:
    ...  # use provided season
else:
    ...  # auto-detect
```

---

#### Return structure

The full season dict from `_season_data`, plus a `detected_season` boolean. Example for spring:

```python
{
    "season": "spring",
    "watering": "Increase watering frequency as plants break dormancy ...",
    "fertilizing": "Resume feeding with a balanced fertilizer ...",
    "light": "Days are lengthening — move plants closer to windows ...",
    "pests": "Watch for spider mites and aphids as temperatures rise ...",
    "detected_season": True   # True = auto-detected; False = caller specified
}
```

---

#### Implementation Notes

*Fill this in after testing.*

**Test: does calling with `season=None` return the correct season for the current month?**
```
Current month: 6 (June)
Expected season: summer
Returned season: Summer  (detected_season: True)
```

**Test: does calling with `season="winter"` return winter data regardless of the current month?**
```
Yes — passing season="winter" in June returns the winter dict with
detected_season: False (caller-specified, not auto-detected).
```
